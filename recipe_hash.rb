#code your solutions here

#1. Create a hash called `perfect_10_recipe` that has the following data:

perfect_10_recipe = {"almond flour" => 2, "gluten freewhole oats" => 1, "kosher salt" => 0.5,
"baking powder" => 0.5, "baking soda" => 0.25, "Xanthan Gum" => 0.5, "slivered almonds, lightly toasted" => 0.25, "mini dark chocolate chips" => 0.75, "olive oil" => 0.5, "agave" => 0.25} 

# All of the ingredients should be symbols and the amounts should be strings. Remember that symbols start with a colon and be sure to sub underscores for spaces.


#2. Write a method that simply returns (not puts) your perfect_10 hash
# def recipe_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
#   $perfect_10_recipe
# end

#2: Write code that returns the amount of chocolate chips from perfect_10 ingredients that is needed in the recipe.
def amount_of_chocolate_chips(perfect_10_recipe)
  
end

#3: Use `puts` to print out every ingredient and amount in the hash by iterating through the collection. You'll want to use the `each` method.
def ingredients_and_amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
  puts perfect_10_recipe.each
end

#4: Now use `puts` to print out just the ingredients without the amounts. You'll want to use the `each_key` method.
def ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
end

#5: Now use `puts` to print out just the amounts without the ingredients. You'll want to use the `each_value` method.
def amounts(perfect_10_recipe)
end

#6: Return the number of ingredients in the `perfect_10_recipe` hash.
def number_ingredients(perfect_10_recipe)
end
